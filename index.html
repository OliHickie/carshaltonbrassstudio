                        We’re offering full class brass tuition which allows the young musicians to learn together and
                        encourage each other in a fun and creative environment. Each pupil will be given a brass
                        instrument and over the course of half a term will be taught the basics of playing by a
                        professional
                        brass musician and teacher. The material used will always be contemporary and relevant with the
                        aim being to perform as a whole class to the rest of the school at the end of the course.

                        Music is a vital part of the cognitive development of any young pupil and we believe that every
                        child should be given the opportunity and have access to learning an instrument. Our six week
                        course will introduce them to basic concepts of music theory as well as the ins and out of how
                        to
                        create a sound on a brass instrument. We believe that we can develop a culture of curiosity
                        about
                        music making and will get the classroom excited about brass!

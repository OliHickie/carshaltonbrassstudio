                    garage’ as it was known then) was
                    built in early 2020 as
                    all lessons moved online. Located at the bottom of the garden, sound proofed and treated, it was
                    initially an act of kindness to the neighbours as our teaching hours meant there was music to be
                    heard all day every day from the house. The studio is now equipped to produce the finest online
                    audio possible and is spacious enough for group, as well as individual, lessons. <br><br> We
                    provide
                    instrument hire options as well as a rehearsal and recording space. Our online ensembles, such
                    as the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/thebigbrassplayalong/?hl=en" target="_blank"
                        class="dark-green-text">#TheBigBrassPlayalong</a>, have proven hugely
                    popular
                    with
                    participants from all across the UK taking part.
                    <br><br> Music theory and brass arranging lessons are
                    taught as well as any brass instrument. Carshalton Brass Studio has self published a book of
                    brass arrangements entitled 'Duets' as well as 'Trios' and have three pieces for full brass band
                    published with <a href="https://www.primavistamusikk.com/" target="_blank"

                        About Cai and Vic
                    </h1>
                    <p class="grey-text">Cai and Vic met whilst studying the trumpet at the Royal Northern College
                        of Music in
                        Manchester.
                        They have over 12 years' experience of teaching all brass instruments to pupils of any
                        ability,
                        from any age group, both within individual lessons and group settings. <br><br> With the
                        sound
                        of
                        trumpet filling the house on a daily basis, they are both deeply passionate about brass
                        playing
                        and aim to excite and motivate their pupils to the same degree. They endeavour to ensure
                        that
                        every pupil fulfils their potential and offer support to those needing a little extra
                        encouragement.<br><br> Huge pride is taken in watching pupils grow and improve. Enjoyment
                        and
                        appreciation are taught alongside a great understanding of all technical aspects of the
                        instrument in all of their lessons and they’re often praised for their efforts to make
                        learning
                        a fun environment.</p>
